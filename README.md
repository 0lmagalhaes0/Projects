### Projects
In here you will find a little portfolio of my code, with a sample project in different areas.

**Burger Place** - My Data Science Certification Capstone Project, where I combine dataframes, heatmaps, K-Means and Rest API to perform a through geographical analysis to choose a place to open a new business (a burger restaurant).

**Web Scraping** - What started as a personal basic cheat sheet on the subject, became a little mini-project, where I Scrape comments from a forum and performed a superficial text analysis, retrieving the most frequent words within the data.

**Capstone 2 / Amazon Reviews** (unfinished) - Another Data Science Capstone Project (this one, unfinished). In this project I use web scrapping, different data visualization techniques and sentiment analysis, as well as create a recommendation system and apply other ML models. Despite having used less due to computacional power, it is a project that is ready to use a database with over 6 million reviews from Amazon's electronics category.
