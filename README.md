### Projects
In here you will find a little portfolio of my code, with a sample project in different areas.

**Burger Place** - My Data Science Certification Capstone Project, where I combine dataframes, heat maps, K-Means and Rest API.

**Web Scraping** - What started as a personal basic cheat sheet on the subject, became a little mini-project, where I Scrape comments from a forum and performed a superficial text analysis, retrieving the most frequent words within the data.

**Amazon Reviews** - IN DEVELOPMENT (to be published soon) - In this project I create a recommendation system and perform other analysis. It uses a database with over 6 million reviews in the electronics category.
